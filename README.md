# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Debouncing : 
        - controls the API call considering the time diff b/w two keys press

typing slow = 200ms time diff b/w key press
typing fast = 50ms time diff b/w key press

performace : 
    - iphone pro max = 14 letters * 1000(members) = 14000
    - with debouncing = 3 API calls * 1000(members) = 3000

Debouncing with 200ms
    - if (diff b/w two key strokes < 200ms) : decline API call
    - if (diff b/w two key strokes >= 200ms) : make API call


### Cache :

    - time complexity of search in array : O(n)
    - time complexity of search in object : O(1)

    - so it better to store the search results in object, rather than array
    - map is more optimised than object, but for the sake of simplicity we are using object here

    - there is also LRU cache - Least Recently Used Cache
    - we can limit the no.of items we store in cache using this
    - like we can limit it to only 100 and if the count increases, we remove the old stored items just like queue


### search bar

    - now our search bar is so powerful because
        - we used live API
        - we used debouncing
        - we used caching
        - we used redux store
        - we used states
